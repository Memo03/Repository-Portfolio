    <h2>First Year
    
    </h2>
            <p>Living life
            Lifeless
            Going through the motions
            Barely passing by<br>           
            Passing the grade
            Was like catching a grenade.
            I had to grow up fast
            And work off my ass.<br>           
            Working to work out
            Winning ships and ballin out
            Football, basketball, volleyball
            I did them all.<br>
            Dependent on someone else
            Not a care in myself. </p><br>
            <h2>Junior Joker</h2>
    <p>This year was crazy.
            I found out my english teacher
            Was my uncles college roommate
            The friend I made last year
            Became a student teacher<br>
            I still didn’t see him much
            But I think we are still friends.
            I wish I could see him more.
            He teaches students
            I hope he’s my teacher
            Next year
            Maybe<br>           
            I didn’t do any sports this year,
            I got mostly A’s
            But my main priority 
            Was SAT’s and ACT’s
            I didn’t try
            At all
            I knew my parents would force me to go to 
            SFSU<br>            
            State is cool, 
            But it isn’t my 
            First choice
            I think it’s too easy  <br>           
            If you go to SF 
            You are already accepted
            There’s no need to try to get 
            Good good grades
            Or good good scores<br>            
            If everyone in SF
            Gets in automatically
            So why am I stressing
            Over everything?<br>           
            I’m gonna have fun this year
            Even if I’m not doing sports
            I’m gonna joke in class
            Have water fights and do crazy things!
            </p>
